## Don't Be Afraid to Ask Stuff

When I was a young middle school kid, I would tend to be (for the most part) the student who would just listen to the teacher without doubting or thinking twice about what the teacher taught us. Like me, there would also be a good portion of students who didn’t bother asking any questions. Then, there were the rest of the students in my class who had the confidence and curiosity of asking the teacher questions with no holds barred. Admittedly, I used to admire my classmates who didn’t care whether their questions were smart ones or not, because they were the ones who created an environment wherein I myself felt comfortable enough to eventually ask our teacher questions. 

If it weren’t for those classmates I had in class, and the patience and respect that most of my teachers had for us, I would still be reluctant to ask my professors today important questions. One common, but perhaps generic saying that I have heard from my teachers in order to encourage students to interact and speak up in class is that “There are no such thing as dumb questions”. To a certain extent, I feel that this statement is true because if a person has a sincere intent to learn something by asking said dumb question, then it is actully a valid question. If a person asks said dumb question without attempting to answer the question themself, then that’s just laziness on their part. However, questions that are asked to incite dumb answers or to waste people’s time are “dumb” from my personal viewpoint. 

## Some Questionable Questions (and valid ones too)

With that in mind, in this essay I would like to discuss the questions that beginning and expert programmers ask, and compare them in order to determine what questions constitute as smart and not-so-smart. To fulfill this comparison, I extracted some questions from Stack Overflow, which is basically one of the best go-to question and answer sites for programmers. Let’s start with analyzing what I would consider to be a [relatively good question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17270628/insertion-sort-vs-bubble-sort-algorithms) that’s been posted. Here, this person has a question regarding the differences between an insertion sort versus a bubble sort algorithm. They start off the post by prefacing and providing what knowledge or understanding they have of each algorithm in a basic summary. Then they actually go through each algorithm, providing a more detailed comparison between the two based on their assumption. Finally, the post author derives their pending conclusion after observing the algorithms and asks the readers if they can reconfirm why they arrived at such a conclusion. This question could be categorized as one that does not necessarily need a new answer, but one that has the reader proofread and check if the author’s knowledge is correct. Overall I found this question to be well constructed from the author and consequently well received by the readers, who have provided lots of constructive feedback of their own, adding their own insight and specific examples to the question as well.

While great questions like these in the majority are often created and asked by people on Stack Overflow, on the other end of the spectrum you will sometimes inevitably have [this kind of question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63842898/can-someone-help-me-building-this).
