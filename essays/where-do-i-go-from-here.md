Software engineering is a field that I thought would never really interest me. Before I became a computer science major, I was just an average person who constantly enjoyed browsing the web on their laptop. So then, how did I go from previously being a moderate consumer of web streaming platforms like Youtube or Spotify to now being a student who is starting to delve into the intricacies of web development and software? One of the reasons was honestly because I did not have any interest in the other majors that were available. But the other main reason was mainly because ever since I was a kid, I loved being creative and making new stuff. 

I believe by taking up the task of learning software engineering I can continue to enjoy the web content that I continue to consume from day to day with a deeper appreciation of how this content is created behind the scenes, while also dreaming of the prospect that someday, I may be able to create my own stuff and have it seen by other people on the web as well! 
However, the initial journey that I had to undergo before even being somewhat comfortable with typing in an IDE was admittedly difficult. When I first started out programming, I recall many times where I would just look at the sample code my CS professor gave me and just blank out. As a visual learner predominantly, even when my professor explained the logic behind the program to me in the best way he could, it was really difficult for me to grasp. 

To this day, I still encounter many frustrations with programming, but I hope that I can someday reach a point where I become competent enough to actually impress other people with my programming skills. Especially in the context of software engineering, I look forward to learning more about the ins and outs of modern websites, and the design philosophy behind some of the more popular social media sites like Twitter, Instagram, etc. How do these websites attract such large daily traffic, and how can I design my websites and applications in a way that will have people coming back to them? These are just one of the many goals I have in mind, and I hope that I can attain the capacity to tackle them in the near future.
