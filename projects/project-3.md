The very first project I had to work on when I took ICS 111 was called "KaGofer". For this project, my class had to create a top-down racing game where the player has to move a car in order to navigate and collect items that are sprawled across a stage. If the player manages to collect all items, they win the game. The main takeaway from this assignment was to have my class and I get acquianted with the EZ Graphics library that was provided to us by our professor. This library was also very powerful in the sense that we could import it and utilize it for all of our projects within ICS 111. 

From doing this project I learned a great deal about the basic concepts of Java, as well as getting familiar with using imported libraries to effectively reduce the amount of coding that I actually have to do.
